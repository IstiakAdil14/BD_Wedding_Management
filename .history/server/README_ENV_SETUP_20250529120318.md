# Environment Variable Setup for Email Sending with SendGrid

To enable sending OTP emails using SendGrid SMTP, you need to set the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file or your deployment environment:

## Required Environment Variables

- `SENDGRID_USER`: Your SendGrid SMTP username. Usually, this is `apikey` for SendGrid.
- `SENDGRID_PASS`: Your SendGrid SMTP password. This is your SendGrid API key.

## Example `.env.local` file

```
SENDGRID_USER=apikey
SENDGRID_PASS=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your_jwt_access_secret
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_jwt_refresh_secret
```

## Steps to obtain SendGrid API key

1. Sign up or log in to your SendGrid account at https://sendgrid.com/.
2. Navigate to **Settings > API Keys**.
3. Create a new API key with "Full Access" or the required permissions.
4. Copy the generated API key.

## Notes

- Use `apikey` as the SMTP username (`SENDGRID_USER`).
- Use the generated API key as the SMTP password (`SENDGRID_PASS`).
- Restart your server after updating environment variables to apply changes.
- Ensure your `.env.local` file is included in `.gitignore` to avoid committing secrets.

## Testing Email Sending

You can test email sending by triggering the signup flow and checking your email inbox for the OTP email.

If you encounter issues, check server logs for detailed error messages.
